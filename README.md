# studentClustering
Utilization of unsupervised learning to perform clustering of students using K-Means Algorithm.  

Kmeans algorithm is used to partition the dataset into K subgroups (clusters) where each data point belongs to only one group.

The dataset used for the clustering is turkish-student-evaluation data. http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/turkiye+student+evaluation 

Optimal K value is found out by visualising the performance score for multiple k values.
